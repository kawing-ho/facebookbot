Hello and welcome to this diary file I made which records the progress of my little project here.
I may or may not be using profanity in this so user discretion is advised.

> Okay so I didnt really want Facebook to track who I was and why I was running an automated
  page that would seemingly be posting spam, so to avoid suspicion I created :

- a new email account (ninjamafia@tutamail.com) courtesy of tutanoa.com 
  That site is super awesome because you don't need a phone number to sign up for it,
  just another email ! 

- a fake facebook account which also runs a Facebook page which I will not name ;) 
  Facebook is actually really smart at identifying bots / fake accounts, 
  I put my name as Beef Burger and they rejected it ;_;
  instead I looked up a fake name generator (can't believe these things even exist) and used those

===================================================================================
27/11/17:

> did heavy amounts of research on how to use the Facebook API.
its actually lowkey annoying, because I want to do it with Python but I also don't want to 
install any SDK for it

===================================================================================
28/11/17:

> Python requests library looks fucking amazing because it can send/receive HTTP 

> I might be using Facebook Graph API which means I need to sign up for developer account

> Still kinda confused by the different tokens but I know that obtaining one allows you 
  to interact with the content as a page / user / the app

===================================================================================
29/11/17:

> Good job Facebook, also this is why we can't have nice things
  They somehow managed to detect that my account wasn't doing anything within 24 hours of signing up
  Maybe that caused it to fail the human test, and they asked me to "upload a profile picture to prove its me" 

> I went "fuck you" and uploaded a piece of chicken and now my fake account is disabled and most likely deleted forever. Fuck.

> SO my plan now is to use my own account to register for Developer ... and run the app from there ?

> I should be fine as long as I don't do anything illegal/stupid right ????

> I'm being lazy, losing my motivation, and I really want to finish as fast as possible.
  I dont know why I'm not retaining any information at all :( 

> I need to get a long-life page access token for my "App" to use
> How do I do that ? well 

> I have to prove that I own the page AND the app first ! 

> Ok I managed to get a short-lived token
  it seems that I need to get a long-lived one so I'll do this : 


https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?
  client_id={APP_ID}&
  client_secret={APP_SECRET}&
  grant_type=fb_exchange_token&
  fb_exchange_token={EXISTING_ACCESS_TOKEN}

> Set up page, since I'm admin I should have 

> I really need to finish this by the end of the week so I can do other shit

> OKay so its doable by curl, get request to return info, post request to do posts I'm sure
  Combine that with python requests and should be able to do some automation
  Need some system to re-request the code each time tho

> Finally got the page access token ! (never expires)

> Okay so posting works ! 
  me/feed?message=Hello World

> Lets try and delete it now !!
  DELETE with /151042402320312_151223835635502 (id)

> Started python script with request.get and it works so far

> Making good progress ! Managed to randomize seed posts, time to fuck around with posting and editing hehehehhehe
> Going to start making the script into a CRON job
> After that I'll start doing the editing ...

> Started research on crontabs and cronjobs, learnt quite a bit and this site has some good examples !  https://crontab.guru/examples.html
  Hourly = 0 * * * * * 

> I also learnt about the notify-send thing which is pretty awesome !

> Weird thing about the script though, when it sends two identical posts back to back I get a non-200 HTTP response , hmmmm

> Will sart meme-ifying tonight

> crontab stopped working after a reboot, wonder why ? 
> never mind I found the bug .. fuck me. 
  */5 * * * * is very different from * */5 * * * but I somehow missed it for like an hour

> Start meme'ing : thinking of examples and putting them into files
> Splitting substitutions into 3 types : 
   - sentences in quotes "like this"
   - use of The/the Bla Bla Bla like the Association 
   - names such as Donald Trump
   - random substitutions in the sentence if its too short/ no earlier substitutions made

> Added exception handling which I discovered when using public Wi-Fi, SSLexception (interesting)

===================================================================================

> Implementations of substitutions underway !!!
> Finished the random substitutions
